I ordered a laffa shawarma and it's solid. The one star is for their horribly rude service. \n\nI was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down/wrapping up/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.\n\nPoint of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM. BUT, with this experience I will NEVER buy from Yalla again.", "likes": 46, "starred": 46, "user_id": "PHSTEBs8VEyXc_Jki-nyHQ"}, {"post_id": "-1ijEwMDLedYlNmy2GHMYg", "stars": 14, "date": "03/04/2015, 20:07:15", "text": "Since discovering Modern Dog I have been a happier dog owner.

My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \n\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \n\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \n\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \n\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\n\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \n\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \n\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\n\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. \n\nWe will not be back.", "likes": 33, "starred": 74, "user_id": "x8yP7N0KeC3HlDNj9lhWyg"}, {"post_id": "-7SDG2P9IIoSagTKP4AqiA", "stars": 6, "date": "12/29/2017, 17:43:10", "text": "Came here for the first time and the store had a huge selection.

Another is busy vaccuuming out french fries from Wendy's, McDonald's, AND Burger King. The third is busy cleaning the dash, windshield, and other interior panels. The cleaning goes like clockwork, and usually, it's done in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe only downside is that if you choose to have the additional services done on your car, you may end up waiting for a bit of time.

My sister order the Morrison which was an herb-marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta.  I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne--one to split with her.  The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche.  Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.

How serious am I? I made an account just to write this review, so.....\n\nI went to Chedds last night on a whim because it sounded like a novel concept: grilled cheese. How can you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich? Imagine all the cheeses they can squish between bread! Delightful.\n\nWe walked in and it was apparent that this was not the type of place I needed to be. There were all these crayon-scribbled pictures of cheese from kids lining the counter, so automatically I'm like, oh, this is one of THOSE places. Aesthetic judgment aside, I went for a BCT -- bacon, tomato, spinach, mayo and smoked cheddar on wheat. Simple enough. I asked for a cup to get some of their unsweetened iced tea from the fountain. This is where the real trouble begins. \n\nAs I was getting my tea, I noticed the strange, vague smell of bad eggs. I thought this was due to the fountain station's proximity to the trash can. I was incorrect. I sat down and took a sip of my iced tea and it tasted sort of foul. I couldn't quite place the actual flavor, but something was clearly not okay about this tea. I opened the lid to smell it (because of course I did), and it smelled like rotten eggs, sort of like sulfur. How does this even happen to iced tea? I had my companion smell the tea, and he agreed that it smelled awful. \n\nI went to the counter to point out this atrocity to the greasy-haired slacker employee. I told him he should smell my drink. He said, \"No, I'm good. I'll check on it, though.\" He gave me a new cup. I hesitantly got myself a Dr. Pepper. In all fairness, he did change out the iced tea immediately, but a smell of that caliber makes me think maybe some heavy duty irrigation of the iced tea machine is in order. Look, I'd be pretty disaffected if I worked at a grilled cheese shop, too, but this was unacceptable.\n\nThe sandwiches themselves are not actual grilled cheese sandwiches. They're more like panini sandwiches, made in a big flat press. They're greasy, the bread doesn't adhere to the cheese, and they're mediocre in flavor at best.

We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. \n\nWe call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying \"master of excellence\". I'm sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesn't have physical space to display that.\n\nHe tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN we'll talk price.\n\nLet's pause for a minute. Suppose you're a Honda dealer and you honestly don't have a relatively popular car. Wouldn't you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, don't you? Of course, you would. Either he didn't have a car or he knew he didn't want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.\n\nSo he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess it's working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didn't stop. He called me like 8 times and I didn't answer.\n\nWe went to that other place the same day and bought the car. \n\nIn summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Don't ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesn't mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply don't know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.\n\nHere's a more detailed account of our buying process: http://www.yelp.com/biz/silko-honda-raynham#hrid:k-v7aipcorfBAbBVzwWKcw", "likes": 48, "starred": 28, "user_id": "1sMZdqmCa_X2Lf_x6XOCFw"}, {"post_id": "0DJIaDqZHe5oVSF_zOPMAA", "stars": 31, "date": "08/03/2016, 23:35:22", "text": "Perhaps not a five star in an urban environment but the menu and wine list here for an airport make it worth a diversion.

Had an incredibly rude customer service experience. Surprised, disappointed, and won't be returning. Even signed up for a Yelp account today to encourage them to increase their professionalism.\n--------------------------\nMore details: Needing to use the bathroom after downing my taro drink, I made for the door with the large bathroom sign on it. An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom's closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I'm a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I'm usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I'm not. I'm not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\n\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That's fine with me.\"\n\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office! And despite your upward creeping prices since, I have come back at least once a year because I loved the unpretentious atmosphere. I'm not sure what changed, but on principle I won't be supporting a business that lacks respect for their customers.\n\n1 star for this experience, +1 star for the memories.", "likes": 62, "starred": 43, "user_id": "i5Cm53q0pmklQsX8soi3tw"}, {"post_id": "0Q5uaGzKf5iYzJ5xBBrG_Q", "stars": 9, "date": "01/27/2017, 21:29:57", "text": "The cayenne hot chocolate is bad, it's thin milk (probably 2%) with a weak powder mix.\n\nThe food is ok, there's a general confusion of flavors.
